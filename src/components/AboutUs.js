      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        First of all, I apologize if there are any similarities in names.
        Actually, this is my project to create a website about tourism in the
        West Java area because I happened to be born there and know several
        tourist areas there.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        My hope is that one day this website will help users find their favorite
        destinations in a more transparent manner at an efficient cost.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        Hopefully West Java tourism will be better known and visited by many
        tourists.
      </p>
    </div>
